# Fastest Possible Dbmonster Implementation

This is likely the fastest possible [Dbmonster](https://dbmonster.firebaseapp.com/) implementation. It is based on a experimental template language which is translated to pure DOM manipulation JavaScript code.

Should you ever find a faster one (which isn't based on WebGL), please report an issue!
